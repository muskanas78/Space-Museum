# Space Museum Database

## Problem Statement
Interstellar exploration has always intrigued humanity, but traditional museums often fail to deliver truly **immersive, interactive experiences** that connect people with the cosmos in meaningful ways. Our goal was to address this challenge by integrating NASA's data as our backend with immersive technology frameworks inspired by global exhibits like:
- **ARTE Museum** (Jeju and Las Vegas)
- **ARTECHOUSE** (New York City, USA)
- **INTER** (New York City, USA)
- **Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience** (London, UK)

The **Space Museum Database** simulates an adaptive museum system set within the **Milky Way Galaxy**, designed to manage exhibits, real-time visitor interactions, and AR/VR multimedia content. The planets include: **Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto**.

## Solution
Our database provides a *sophisticated system* engineered to facilitate:
- Scientific exhibit management using NASA's real-world celestial data
- Equipment and tech installations tracking (AR/VR, projection mapping)
- Dynamic visitor interaction reports and personalized feedback mechanisms

The platform is divided into **three core interfaces**, each customized for different roles:

### 1. Administration Interface
- Launches new exhibits based on visitor registration (10–50/session)
- Manages staff schedules, approval flows, and multimedia guidelines
- Generates detailed reports:
  - **Exhibit Performance**
  - **Staff Allocation**
  - **Maintenance Alerts**
  - **Financial Summaries**

### 2. Employee Interface
- Handles day-to-day ticketing, safety compliance, and emergency support
- Logs and monitors AR/VR and projector status
- Tracks:
  - **Group Bookings**
  - **Equipment Status**
  - **Daily Visitor Logs**

### 3. Visitor Interface
- Enables browsing and booking of immersive experiences
- Provides:
  - **Personalized Visit Summaries**
  - **Membership Benefits & Tier Tracking**
  - **Feedback History with Curator Responses**

> Immersive technologies like **AR, VR, and projection mapping** don't just inform, they transform perception. They offer an escape into curated realities, making learning deeply personal, emotional, and memorable.

## Key Features
- Real-time capacity and tech status monitoring
- NASA data integration to ensure celestial accuracy
- Automated exhibit approval workflows with cost/size/media validation
- Membership tracking and tier upgrades
- Specialized query links each planet in the database to its corresponding **3D visual and scientific profile** on NASA’s official website, allowing curators and visitors to explore each celestial body’s physical appearance, rotation, surface details, and more in real time

## Tools & Technologies
- **SSMS & SQL Server** (for SQL queries)
- **Visual Paradigm** (ER Diagram design)
- **Microsoft Access** (relational database design, reports, forms)
- **Microsoft Word** (schema modeling and documentation)
- **OOP inheritance concepts for role-based logic**

## Data Sources
Special thanks to NASA for providing publicly accessible, science-backed data and interactive assets that shaped the foundation of this project:

- [NASA Planetary Fact Sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/) – For scientific parameters like orbital periods, mass, diameter, and temperatures of planets and moons.
- [NASA Science: Solar System Overview](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/) – For structured and educational content about planets, moons, and other celestial bodies.
- [NASA Eyes on the Solar System](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home) – For interactive 3D modeling and real-time visualization of planets, moons, and spacecraft.
- [NASA GLTF Embed for Planetary Models](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/gltf_embed/2364/) – For embedding stunning 3D visuals and textures directly into user-facing reports and the database.

> All data sources were used strictly for academic and educational purposes under publicly available NASA open-access guidelines.
